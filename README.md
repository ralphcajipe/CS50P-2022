# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python  <br> (CS50P)

This repository is my journal for studying CS50P 2022. Changes made are mostly through utlization of PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code and some experiments on the Python syntax. This course material is offered by Harvard University via OpenCourseWare https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/.

## About the course
An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with and without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Plus exceptions and debugging; unit tests; libraries; file I/O; regular expressions; and classes, objects, methods, and properties. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.
